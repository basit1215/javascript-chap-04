<!-- What are illegal variable names?

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. A variable name cannot start with a number. A
variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) Variable names are
case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


What is a legal variable name?
Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they cannot start with a number.
It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll see
why later). The underscore character ( _ ) can appear in a name.

JavaScript Identifiers
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). The general rules for
constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar
signs. Names must begin with a letter.

Alphanumeric Defined
Alphanumeric, also known as alphameric, simply refers to the type of Latin and Arabic characters representing the
numbers 0 - 9, the letters A - Z (both uppercase and lowercase), and some common symbols such as @ # * and &.


What is a underscore symbol?
Term. Definition. Underscore. The underscore [ _ ] (also called understrike, underbar, or underline) is a character that
originally appeared on the typewriter and was primarily used to underline words.

A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores ( a-z, A-Z , 0-9 , and _ ) Variable names are
case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character (_) A variable name cannot start with a digit. A
variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores ( a-z, A-Z , 0-9 , and _ ) Variable names are
case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Variable names are case sensitive. So, Age, AGE, aGE and AgE could be names for different variables, although this is
not recommended since it would probably cause confusion and errors in your programs. Let's look at some variable
declarations to better understand these rules.

Which is not a valid JavaScript variable name?
JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore
character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.

For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid. JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral
(0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but
_123test is a valid one

Which variable name is not allowed?
Specifically, spaces are not permitted in the variable names, as variable name must be a single word. Variable name may
not start with a digit or underscore, and may not end with an underscore. Double underscores are not permitted in
variable name. -->
